## **Description:**  
**ARP Spoofing Detector and Response** is an open-source tool designed to detect and mitigate ARP spoofing attacks within a local network. 
It aims to enhance network security by identifying potential spoofing attempts and countering them by restoring the integrity of the local ARP cache and sending ARP packets with the correct information to compromised systems.

## **Key Features:**

- **Spoofing Detection**: Monitors ARP packets to detect spoofing attempts.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs information about detected spoofing attempts for analysis.
- **ARP Cache Restoration**: Restores local ARP cache entries.
- **Spoofing Effects Mitigation**: Mitigates the effects of ARP spoofing by sending packets to any machine under attack within a local network (Windows or Linux).
- **No Amplification of Attack**: Responds only with trusted MAC addresses, thereby avoiding amplification of spoofing attacks.
