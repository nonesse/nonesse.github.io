## Tasks

<SherlockTask 
    task_number="1" 
    task_content="Attackers can abuse the vssadmin utility to create volume shadow snapshots and then extract sensitive files like NTDS.dit to bypass security mechanisms.
     Identify the time when the Volume Shadow Copy service entered a running state." 
    hint_content="" 
    answer="2024-05-14 03:42:16"/>

- The events related to the services are located in `SYSTEM.evtx`, so we will search in our `system.txt` to see if any of the events are related to the state changes of a service.

- We see that the description of event `7036` says `Service State Change`, which seems to be the event we are looking for.

<SherlockBodyImage src="/blog/sherlocks/crown_jewel_1_images/CrownJewel1_task_1_1.png"/>

- Sice it occurs 106 times, we must filter by `Volume Shadow Copy` in the field that indicates the service name, which in this case is `.EventData.param1`. To do this, we run this command:

<CodeBlock code={"cat events.json | jq '.[].Event | select(.System.EventID == 7036) | select(.EventData.param1 == \"Volume Shadow Copy\")'"}/>

- As a result, we will obtain the event we are looking for. Our answer is in the field `.System.TimeCreated_attributes.SystemTime`. 

<SherlockBodyImage src="/blog/sherlocks/crown_jewel_1_images/CrownJewel1_task_1_2.png"/>

<SherlockTask  
    task_number="2" 
    task_content="When a volume shadow snapshot is created, the Volume shadow copy service validates the privileges using the Machine account and enumerates User groups. Find the two user groups the volume 
    shadow copy process queries and the machine account that did it." 
    hint_content="" 
    answer="Administrators, Backup Operators, DC01$"/>

- The events related to security, such as privilege validation, can be found in `SECURITY.evtx`, so we will look in our `security.txt`.

<SherlockBodyImage src="/blog/sherlocks/crown_jewel_1_images/CrownJewel1_task_2_1.png"/>

- In this file we can see that event `4799` lists members of the local group. We will filter for that event when it is executed by the VSS process.
<CodeBlock code={"cat events.json | jq '.[].Event | select(.System.EventID == 4799) | select(.EventData.CallerProcessName == \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\VSSVC.exe\")'"}/>

- We find different groups listed in the `.EventData.TargetUserName` field and the machine account in `.EventData.SubjectUserName`.

<SherlockBodyImage src="/blog/sherlocks/crown_jewel_1_images/CrownJewel1_task_2_2.png"/>

- First, let's go to the user groups. We can retrieve the values from the `.EventData.TargetUserName` field and remove duplicates:
<CodeBlock code={"cat events.json | jq '.[].Event | select(.System.EventID == 4799) | select(.EventData.CallerProcessName == \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\VSSVC.exe\") | .EventData.TargetUserName'|sort -u"}/>

- It returns the two groups we need: `Administrators` and `Backup Operators`. First part completed, now let's move on to the second.

- Just like before, we can retrieve the values for the field `EventData.SubjectUserName` and remove duplicates:
<CodeBlock code={"cat events.json | jq '.[].Event | select(.System.EventID == 4799) | select(.EventData.CallerProcessName == \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\VSSVC.exe\") | .EventData.SubjectUserName'|sort -u"}/>

- The result it returns is `DC01$`. We now have the complete answer.

<SherlockTask  
    task_number="3" 
    task_content="Identify the Process ID (in Decimal) of the volume shadow copy service process." 
    hint_content="" 
    answer="4496"/>

- The number is in hexadecimal in the `.EventData.CallerProcessId` field for `.EventData.CallerProcessName == C:\\Windows\\System32\\VSSVC.exe`: 
    - `0x1190`

- We use python to convert that value into decimal: 
<CodeBlock code={"python"}/>

- We paste the value and press enter. It will return us the Process ID in decimal.
	- `4496`

<SherlockBodyImage src="/blog/sherlocks/crown_jewel_1_images/CrownJewel1_task_3.png"/>

---

<SherlockTask  
    task_number="4" 
    task_content="Find the assigned Volume ID/GUID value to the Shadow copy snapshot when it was mounted." 
    hint_content="" 
    answer="{06c4a997-cca8-11ed-a90f-000c295644f9}"/>

- The events related to files and volumes are located in `NTFS.evtx`, so we will check our `ntfs.txt`.

<SherlockBodyImage src="/blog/sherlocks/crown_jewel_1_images/CrownJewel1_task_4_1.png"/>

- The event `4` has the description `File system volume mounted`. We will filter by that `EventID`:
<CodeBlock code={"cat events.json | jq '.[].Event | select(.System.EventID == 4)'"}/>

- The command returns a series of events, and we can see that the last one is related to `Volume Shadow Copy`.
<SherlockBodyImage src="/blog/sherlocks/crown_jewel_1_images/CrownJewel1_task_4_2.png"/>

- To ensure that there are no more events with `.EventData.DeviceName = "\\Device\\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1"`, we can retrieve the value of  `.EventData.VolumeCorrelationId` for that `DeviceName`, which is the field they are asking about, and remove the duplicates.
<CodeBlock code={"cat events.json | jq '.[].Event | select(.EventData.DeviceName == \"\\\\Device\\\\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\")| .EventData.VolumeCorrelationId' |sort -u"}/>

- This command will return a single `VolumeCorrelationId` confirming that it is the one we are looking for.

---

<SherlockTask  
    task_number="5" 
    task_content="Identify the full path of the dumped NTDS database on disk." 
    hint_content="" 
    answer="C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\backup_sync_Dc\Ntds.dit"/>

- The $MFT file acts as a database that contains information about all the files and directories on an NTFS partition. That is where we will find our answer.

- We need to convert this file to a format we can work with, so we will use `Chainsaw` again to create a JSON.

- First, we must move to `C` folder and rename the file to avoid usign the dollar symbol `$`:
<CodeBlock code={"mv $MFT mtf.bin"}/>

- Then we convert the file to JSON format using `Chainsaw`:
<CodeBlock code={"/opt/chainsaw/chainsaw dump mft.bin --json > files.json "}/>    

- Now that we have a format which we can work with, we filter by `ntds.dit`:
<CodeBlock code={"cat files.json | grep -i ntds.dit"}/>    
    
<SherlockBodyImage src="/blog/sherlocks/crown_jewel_1_images/CrownJewel1_task_5_1.png"/>

- We now know the name of the field where the full path is stored, `.FullPath`, so we will search for all entries that contain the text `ntds.dit` in that field:
<CodeBlock code={"cat files.json | jq '.[] | select(.FullPath | test(\"ntds.dit\")) | .FullPath'"}/>    

<SherlockBodyImage src="/blog/sherlocks/crown_jewel_1_images/CrownJewel1_task_5_2.png"/>

- Of all the paths, the most suspicious one is `Users/Administrator/Documents/backup_sync_dc/ntds.dit` for several reasons:
    1. At first glance, it doesn't seem like a very secure location for a critical database like `ntds.dit`.
    2. It's not the default location for the `ntds.dit` database; the default location is `Windows/NTDS/ntds.dit`.
    3. The name of the directory `backup_sync_dc` suggests that an attacker is trying to back up something related to the Domain Controller (DC).

- That is our answer.

<SherlockTask  
    task_number="6" 
    task_content="When was newly dumped ntds.dit created on disk?" 
    hint_content="" 
    answer="2024-05-14 03:44:22"/>

- This information is stored in the field `.StandardInfoCreated`, and we can retrieve it with:
<CodeBlock code={"cat files.json | jq '.[] | select(.FullPath == \"Users/Administrator/Documents/backup_sync_dc/ntds.dit\") | .StandardInfoCreated'"}/>  

---

<SherlockTask  
    task_number="7" 
    task_content="A registry hive was also dumped alongside the NTDS database. Which registry hive was dumped and what is its file size in bytes?" 
    hint_content="In the MFT results file, filter for the identified folder path where the attacker dumped the NTDS database. 
    It will display any other file created on that path as well." 
    answer="SYSTEM, 17563648"/>

- The registry hives are usually files without an extension and can have names like `SYSTEM`, `SECURITY`, `SAM`...

- If a registry hive was dumped along with the NTDS database, it may be located in the same directory `backup_sync_dc`.

- We search for entries with that name, retrieving only the  `.FullPath` to see if any file looks like a hive:
<CodeBlock code={"cat files.json | jq '.[] | select(.FullPath | test(\"backup_sync_dc\")) | .FullPath'|sort -u"}/>  
    
<SherlockBodyImage src="/blog/sherlocks/crown_jewel_1_images/CrownJewel1_task_7_1.png"/>

- Of all the results, the only one that looks like a hive is `"Users/Administrator/Documents/backup_sync_dc/SYSTEM"`. We access the file to see its information:
<CodeBlock code={"cat files.json | jq '.[] | select(.FullPath == \"Users/Administrator/Documents/backup_sync_dc/SYSTEM\")'"}/>  

<SherlockBodyImage src="/blog/sherlocks/crown_jewel_1_images/CrownJewel1_task_7_2.png"/>

- The answer will be `SYSTEM` and the file size can be found in `.FileSize`.
